            <p>{Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
                But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 
                be broken by love's first kiss.
                She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing 
                dragon.
                Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, 
                but non prevailed.
                She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest 
                tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
